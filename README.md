# ðŸ“·CAMERA dataset
CAMERA (CyberAgent Multimodal Evaluation for Ad Text GeneRAtion) is the Japanese ad text generation dataset.
We hope that our dataset will be useful in research for realizing more advanced ad text generation models.
The dataset is splitted into `train.csv`, `dev.csv`, and `test.csv`. LP (Landing Pages) images are stored in the `lp-screenshot/` and are associated with the text data (`*.csv`) by asset ids (`asset_id`).
