# ðŸ“·CAMERA dataset
CAMERA (CyberAgent Multimodal Evaluation for Ad Text GeneRAtion) is the Japanese ad text generation dataset.
We hope that our dataset will be useful in research for realizing more advanced ad text generation models.
The dataset is split into `train.csv`, `dev.csv`, and `test.csv`. LP (Landing Pages) images are stored in the `lp-screenshot/` and are associated with the text data (`*.csv`) by asset ids (`asset_id`).

# Updats
- [Our paper](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.54/) has been accepted to [ACL2024](https://2024.aclweb.org/)ðŸŽ‰[2024-08-13]
  - Major updates have been made to the dataset accordingly (V2.2.0).

However, the lack of comprehensive benchmarks and well-defined problem sets has made comparing different methods challenging. To tackle these challenges, we standardize the task of ATG and propose a first benchmark dataset, CAMERA, carefully designed and enabling the utilization of multi-modal information and facilitating industry-wise evaluations. Our extensive experiments with a variety of nine baselines, from classical methods to state-of-the-art models including large language models (LLMs), show the current state and the remaining challenges. We also explore how existing metrics in ATG and an LLM-based evaluator align with human evaluations.",
